        <h4>My contributions</h4>
        <h4>Self Billed Invoices</h4>
        <p>Usually, Seller provides invoice to the buyer during purchase. Self billing is a contract between a buyer and seller for a specific period of time. During this period, buyer can raise invoice and get the products from the seller and send the invoice to seller. </p>
        <p>Challenges I faced here was to develop a module in the purchase section that has requirements of both sales and purchase modules like raising the invoice based on rules and regulation in seller location rather than the business location, mailing the seller about the invoices, template level changes, import and export, accounting entries, vat accounting, etc </p>
